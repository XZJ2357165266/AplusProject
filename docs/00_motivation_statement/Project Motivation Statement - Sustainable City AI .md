# Project Motivation Statement - Sustainable City AI

## Understanding of the Project Requirements

This project aims to develop a modular, AI-powered multi-agent system to support Europe's carbon neutrality goals. It will provide real-time insights and personalized suggestions on energy use, carbon intensity, and pricing, using data from official sources. Users will interact with the system through chat platforms (e.g., Telegram) or a simple web interface.

The system includes five agents, connected via secure, context-awar Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. We plan to implement this through three main components:

- User-Facing Frontend Modules: Telegram will handle user interaction, while a lightweight web interface will display trend charts, low-carbon time windows, and daily reports. Backend logic will manage message routing, GPT-based report generation, and data visualization.
- Admin & Monitoring Modules: An internal web dashboard will show system health, logs, and allow manual controls such as data refresh or service restarts. Backend services will support real-time monitoring, log tracking, and admin-triggered actions.
- MAS and MCP Layer: Agents will collect and process carbon, pricing, and policy data. GPT will be used for summarizing policy documents and generating reports. MCP servers (Java + Spring Boot) will provide encrypted APIs, manage context sharing, and be deployed on Microsoft Azure.

## Technical Competence and Team Match

Our team has strong experience in building full-stack intelligent systems and has worked with the key technologies required by this project:

- Product Planning: One member has over three years of product management experience, supporting clear feature prioritization and user-centric system design.
- Chat Integration: We have implemented Telegram bots and understand message routing, intent parsing, and system integration.
- Web Development: We can build interactive web pages for report display, chart visualization, and admin tools.
- Backend Development: We have over three years of experience using Java and Spring Boot to develop secure APIs, including cloud deployment and microservices on Azure.
- API Integration: We are experienced in accessing external energy APIs such as EirGrid, ENTSO-E, and SEAI, and processing real-time data.
- LLM Integration: We have used OpenAI GPT APIs to generate structured responses, summaries, and PDF reports.
- Monitoring & Logging: We understand how to design systems with traceable logs, health checks, and exception handling.

With this balanced skill set and strong collaboration, we are confident and motivated to deliver a secure, well-designed, and impactful AI assistant for sustainable energy.
